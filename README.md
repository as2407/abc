# Faster Segmentation of Cardiac MRI using U-Net


The project focuses on **multiclass** medical image segmentation, employing **U-Net** architecture for pixel-level classification of left ventricle endocardium (LV), 
left ventricle myocardium (Myo), right ventricle endocardium (RV), and background in MRI scans. 
This technique aids cardiologists in automating the diagnosis of heart conditions like infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and abnormal right ventricle. 
The approach aims for efficient MRI diagnosis automation with minimal training data, utilizing metrics such as **IOU** or **Dice** for segmentation accuracy assessment.
